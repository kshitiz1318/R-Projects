### K nearest neign=bour



## To build  model which will be able to predict which species the flower belong to based on different features

## Knn is good with numerical


## We can see that sepal length varies from 4.3 to 7.9
## sepal width varies from 2 to 4.4
## petal length varies from 1 to 6.9 (wider range)
## petal width varies from 0.100 to 2.5 (less range)


## the problem with different changes
## the features having larger values will have an undue influence on the prediction
## since Knn uses a distance function
## it should be normalised


## the value ten will be between 0 and 1
## 



## square root of totla no. of observations should genrally be the value of 12
## if we generally have a tie we should select odd no. for k
## square root of 150 is between 12 1nd 13
## choose 13 since its an odd no.
